# Bootstrap Patterns
_Component led design patterns with Nunjucks, Grunt &amp; Bootstrap._

Working demonstrations of how Nunjucks, Grunt, and a CSS framework (Bootstrap in this case) can be combined into reusable design patterns to achieve multiple variations.

## Installation

I'm assuming you already have node before you start if not then you'll need to [install it](https://nodejs.org/en/) before proceeding.

* Git: `git clone https://github.com/morganfeeney/bootstrap-patterns.git`

Once you have your location sorted, `cd` to the root directory of bootstrap-patterns using terminal (or cmd if using a PC), then run: `npm install` if you have admin rights, otherwise `sudo npm install`. Once NPM has finished with the installation of packages you can run the task `grunt`.

### Grunt

[Grunt docs](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started)

### Task

Simply run the default task `grunt`, and you'll be good to go.
